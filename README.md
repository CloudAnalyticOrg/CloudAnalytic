# CloudAnalytic

CloudAnalytic is a free and open-source web application built using Blazor on .NET 8.0. It tracks user activity on websites and apps while respecting user privacy. CloudAnalytic anonymizes and hashes personal data like IP addresses and device information to generate pseudo "users" with randomized names such as "John Doe." It provides insight into user navigation, page visits, and conversion actions like purchases.

## Features

- **User Anonymization**: Personal details such as IP and device information are hashed and randomized to protect user privacy.
- **Randomized User Names**: Each user is assigned a randomized alias like "John Doe" for tracking purposes.
- **Track User Activity**: Get detailed insights into which pages users visit, how they navigate, and whether they complete key actions like purchases.
- **Event Tracking**: Capture specific user actions such as clicks, page views, and purchases.
- **Open Source**: Free to use, modify, and contribute under the AGPL 3.0 license.
